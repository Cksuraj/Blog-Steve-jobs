        Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other
        people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out
        your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow
        your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want
        to become. Everything else is secondary.

        <p class=" ">
          Most people don’t get the wonderful experiences because they never
          ask. I have never found anybody that didn’t want to help me if I asked
          them for help. I have never found anyone who said no and hung up the
          phone when I called. Most people never pick up the phone and call,
          most people never ask and that’s what seperates sometimes the people
          who do things and the people who just dream about them.

          You got to act. You got to be willing to fail. Willing to crash and
          burn. If you are afraid of failing you won’t get very far. Start
          Young: I started Apple when I was 20, Woz was maybe 24 or 25. We had
          no families, no children, no houses. We had nothing to lose and
          everything to again. And we figured, even if we crash and burn and
          lose everything, the experience will have been 10 times the cost.
          There was no risk.

          <br />

          I want to put a ding in the universe. Your time is limited, so don’t
          waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which
          is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Start your
          business when you are young. Simple can be harder than complex: You
          have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.
